# YAYAB

**Y**et **A**nother **Y**outube **A**udio **B**ot is a discord bot built designed to be hosted locally for your own server.

Unlike publicly hosted bots that can do seemingly everything *but* play youtube, YAYAB is designed to do exactly that and do it well. 

Also unlike publicly hosted bots, YAYAB is completely open source and even designed for you to run for yourself, allowing you to make changes, add features, and most importantly, means it cannot be shutdown by YouTube. 

As long as the yt-dlp project is working, this bot will remain functional and untouchable by YouTube.
